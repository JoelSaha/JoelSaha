#  Hello, I'm Joel Saha!

 I'm an Electronics and Communication Engineering student passionate about intelligent embedded systems, robotics, and edge AI.

## ðŸ“˜ Projects

1.  **AI-based Wildfire Prediction and Alert System**  
   Built an ML-powered wildfire risk prediction system using the Renesas QC-BEKITPOCZ Kit. Designed and deployed a real-time alert system with Node.js and MySQL to notify users of potential wildfires.


2.  **ASL Actuating Robotic Hand**  
   Created a 3D-printed robotic hand capable of translating speech into ASL. Utilized Python and NLP for speech analysis, with real-time motor actuation controlled via the PyFirmata2-Arduino interface.

3.  **Adaptive Cruise Control with STM32**  
   Developed an embedded adaptive cruise control system using STM32. Employed ultrasonic sensing for object detection and dynamically adjusted DC motor speed using PWM to maintain safe distances, replicating real-world autonomous vehicle behavior.
